# Project Snapshot

## Current Product Stage
The product is currently in the **Content Collector** stage (Stage 1 of 3, preceding Builder and Publisher). The core focus is collecting normalized content from configured Facebook sources while maintaining strict isolation between profile management, collection orchestration, and content storage.

## Current Active Sprint
Sprint 055: Operator Authentication Recovery and Reprovisioning (Active).
Sprint 054B: Runtime Authentication Health Reporting and Checkout Enforcement (Accepted).
Sprint 054A: Profile Authentication Health Foundation (Accepted).

## Currently Available Capabilities
- **Profile Management**: Creation, lifecycle, session ingestion, checkout leasing, and operator-driven recovery reprovisioning for `REAUTH_REQUIRED` and `CHECKPOINT_REVIEW_REQUIRED` profiles.
- **Content Management**: Storage of normalized Facebook knowledge group text posts and top comments.
- **Collection Execution**: Headless browser extraction using Playwright (or experimental CloakBrowser). Worker processes automatically consume queued collection runs, ambient exercise runs, and access-check runs.
- **Operator Tools**: CLI tools for profile provisioning, manual collection, worker execution, browser probing, and the same provisioning CLI used for first-time and recovery login.
- **Web UI**: Dashboard for managing profiles, source groups, categories, content items, and reviewing run status. The profile detail page now displays `authenticationHealth` and a generalized provisioning card for `Start Provisioning`, `Issue New Provisioning Token`, `Start Reauthentication`, and `Start Manual Checkpoint Recovery`.

## Current Modules
- **Collector Profile Manager**: Identity, sessions, provisioning, readiness, leases.
- **Content Manager**: Categories, source groups, normalized content, deduplication.
- **Collector Runtime**: Collection orchestration, browser providers, extraction, submission.
- **Web UI**: Operator presentation and safe API consumption.

## Important Architectural Invariants
- Hexagonal architecture: Domain logic has zero dependencies on HTTP, databases, browsers, or queues.
- Security: Raw session data (cookies, tokens, proxy credentials) and raw Facebook private payloads are never exposed to the UI, logs, or persistent records.
- Separation of Concerns: Profile readiness/leasing is owned entirely by Profile Manager. Browsers consume leases but do not determine profile eligibility.

## Important Unresolved Risks
- Scale of active profile checkout frequency vs PostgreSQL concurrency.
- Long-term viability of browser provider evasion capabilities (e.g. Playwright vs CloakBrowser) against Facebook fingerprinting.
- Future Content Builder handoff payload structure.

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:db
pnpm test:http:db
pnpm web:typecheck
pnpm web:build
```

## Immediate Next Expected Work
Sprint 055 closes the operator recovery loop over the runtime
authentication health reporting and checkout enforcement surface
area established by Sprint 054B. Future sprint work after Sprint 055
will build on the closed recovery and reprovisioning flow.
